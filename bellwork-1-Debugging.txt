Please describe in detail your feelings about where you currently are in JavaScript programming. Please include how well you feel that you have mastered it, as well as listing those things that you think are a challenge to you. Any feedback about whre you are, and where you think you need to go, or would like to go, will be very helpful in getting you there.

Please describe in detail the types of "bugs" a coder can expect to encounter when coding a web page with JavaScript. Describe the techniques you have learned to resolve the types of bugs that we have examined so far. Quote an outside source containing information on resolving this type of bug.
--A coder can expect to come across 3 different bugs; syntax, logic, & run-time.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, the difference between syntax bugs and logic bugs. Describe the differences in technique in the way that they are resolved. Use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.
--Syntax bugs occur when the coder makes a mistake in the code, ie a typo or missing character. A logic bug occurs when there is an error the the program itself, therefor hindering its performance.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, the three different techniques that we have learned so far to resolve logic bugs. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?  For this bell work, you do not need to use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what we can use a debugger for and how it is used. For what types of situations is a debugger the best choice for resolving bugs? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a debugger?  For this bell work, you do not need to use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, the four JavaScript key words that are used for Exception Handling. Briefly describe the purpose of each. What are the advantages of the using the techniques of Exception Handling in your coding? For this bell work, you do not need to use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.
--Try, catch, throw, & finally. The first statement allows the user to test a block a code for errors. The second statement handles the error itself. The third statement will create self-made errors. The finale statement executes the code after trying & catching.

Please describe in detail, in your own words, what you think are the most important take-aways that you got from the unit on debugging techniques. How will these techniques help you be successful in your coding? For this bell work, you do not need to use an outside source to provide additional information that is relevant to this particular subject matter.
